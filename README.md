# AWS-VPC-Terraform
The AWS project focuses on deploying and maintaining cloud infrastructure using Amazon Web Services (AWS). It includes setting up multiple AWS resources such as EC2 instances, VPCs, subnets, security groups, and load balancers with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform. The task also includes creating instances with the appropriate software, testing load balancing, and ensuring secure access via key management and private networking. This assignment provides participants with hands-on experience automating cloud deployments and managing scalable, reliable, and secure applications in the AWS environment.
